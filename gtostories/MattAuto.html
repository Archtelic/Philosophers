            <p><strong>MattInYourEyes Lore - Autobiography</strong></p>
            <p>I'm dominantly German, so I would say I grew up in Germany with the harsh conditions being that my father was a mercenary. I was taught the blade at a young age. My Father, due to him being a mercenary, was assassinated by the brotherhood. Due to lack of protection from the brotherhood, my Mother fled me to France, known for its astounding wealth and security. Currently, just as of today, the French were greatly in the interests of the Grand Templar Order, having multiple soldiers inhabiting the town.</p>

            <p>However, due to outbursts, a drunk templar quickly caused commotion. My mother and I, seeking refuge, had no choice but to put up with his games, until alas, a chasseur had arrived.</p>

            <p>Due to the commotion of the chasseur's arrival, the templar had gained a wild aggression due to him being so restricted, drawing his blade not knowing any better due to drunkenness. In a swift motion, the chasseur had leapt in front of me, guarding me with his mighty shield. I saw an engraving up the back, “Pour la justice et l'honneur.” (“For Justice and Honour”).</p>

            <p>Astoundingly, with a blow, he knocked the templar to his feet. Upon arresting him for public misconduct, he then shifted his attention towards me. Sadly, at the time I couldn't understand him. All I understood was his name, “Jacques De Molay.”</p>

            <p>Upon reaching the age of physical maturity, I was enlisted into the ranks of the GTO. My spirits were high, considering our enemy being the ones that took my Father.</p>

            <p>My first deployment was in the early spring, to an assassin fort named “Eryas.” We were tasked with pushing out assassins residing in nearby farmland. Admittingly, I was a fool who knew no better than the basic principles due to enlistment training. Just as my comrades beside me, we blatantly searched, not expecting to find anything, until our supervisor was stabbed by an assassin hiding within barrels of an attic.</p>

            <p>Adrenaline had struck once more. In quick haste, I grabbed my sword and swung, pushing the assassin back. Then, in quick motion, I grabbed my fallen brother's shield. It felt oddly natural to me at the time, being able to block slashes with ease. After mere seconds, we had driven him into a corner, allowing us to finally finish him off.</p>

            <p>We reported the incident immediately where I met him once more, Jacques De Molay. He had cold eyes, with an aura of wisdom about them. After being debriefed about the battle, he had given his respects to his fallen brother, and then to me, he sought out that I become a part of Chasseurs, personally setting up a date for me to try out for their ranks.</p>

            <p>The training was rigorous, the armor and shield far heavier than I have ever known, yet something within pushed me onward. Alas, the final trial had arisen, a duel between a member of Chasseurs versus me. My body was tired and knew not of what it fought for. In the time of struggle, I thought I would simply fall with the impending attacks between us both, but then my mind responded, giving a sense of understanding. In this understanding, I gained the reason as to why I fought for this position, for honor and for glory! Quickly gripping my sword and shield tighter than I have ever done before, releasing an all-out assault on my foe.</p>

            <p>Until alas, he fell to his feet. Never had I known such a feeling, and yet it was amazing. I was assigned into the ranks of the Chasseurs, given new armor, and training based on the techniques of the French designed for their bulky armor and shields.</p>

            <p>My body saw massive improvements. As time passed, I began studying the laws of the land, in a use of means to climb the ranks enforcing justice, and dominating the front lines so that no civilian would have suffered as I had in my homeland of Germany.</p>

            <p>Through my studies, I quickly became acknowledged after the promotion of velieur given to me by "Ghost." Alas, my duties were needed elsewhere in dangerous territory, where I had been moved to the Lands of Eden, our fortress being within the walls of Isadora. My opinion was recognized, for I had climbed the ranks of not only templars, but chasseurs. My ideas were shared throughout the order, being personally invited to speak with the newest Seneschal Sage, and enforcement of laws and order being brought to the Primarch Aqua.</p>

            <p>During my time, most of it was regular, just having to deal with more Assassins near territory, our task being simply "expansion." I was fighting alongside the one who had brought me into the order itself, Jacques. We were tasked with pushing out the assassin brotherhood in the city known as "Alcaire." However, tragedy struck. New foes never once seen had risen. They wore black, their masks hiding their faces, their eyes were as dead as night, comparable to what you might call, “Phantoms.”</p>

            <p>We were quickly overwhelmed. Their forces had smelted our fallen brothers' armour, and reforged it to use against us. Vipers in green quickly swarmed us. We were surrounded in a matter of minutes with bodies falling by the second. My body sought forgiveness. Cuts and arrows being lodged into my skin. In a moment quicker than I have ever known, I received a slash from behind. I found myself falling to the floor. Everything was red. I couldn't see, I only heard yelling. I laid there motionless for just a second, until my eyes became clear, and a light was shown.</p>

            <p>At the time I had only heard rumors through the ancient library of such divine light, in which a hooded figure stood before me. At first, it was unclear as to what it was saying. Slowly, however, it began to whisper something to me… The oath that I had taken so long ago. In recalling this, the arrows in my body soon became dust, my sight was restored and my cuts vanished as if they were never there. There is only one term that could explain such a thing, Divine Intervention.</p>

            <p>I quickly rose to my feet, leading my comrades away as we retreated. Many were lost that day, but their cost led me to a greater purpose within the order. Jacques was sadly a part of the cost. However, Sage quickly filled his spot in which he revealed the true order. This had revealed the aspects of divine intervention to me, granting me to harness it as a weapon.</p>

            <p>Upon becoming a part of the true order, I was given the assignment to rise further into the ranks. Becoming a Templar Knight, I was told to train those below so that we may soon get revenge for that day. In continuing my studies of the law, and execution of such, I was given the rank Execeuter with my superiors at the time being Ghost and Aqua. Shortly after Aqua had passed, his condition was flawed with sickness. As a result, Ghost was chosen to step up. In such close regard to him, he made me his right-hand man.</p>
