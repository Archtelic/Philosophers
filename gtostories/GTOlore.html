            <p>The Grand Templar Order Lore<br>
            “Even when your kind appears to triumph, still we rise again. And do you know why? Because the Order is born from a realization. We require no creed, no indoctrination by desperate old men. All we need is the world be as it is, & this is why the Templars will never be destroyed.”<br>
            “If everything is permitted, then no one is safe”<br>
            “May the Father of Understanding guide us”<br>
            “Non Nobis Domine”<br>
            “Deus Vult”</p>

            <p><strong>OLD WORLD TEMPLARS</strong><br>
            Established in 1119 on Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the Order of the Knights Templar traces its origins to the Old World under the leadership of Hugh de Payens, the inaugural Grand Master. Originally known as the Order of the Ancients, they were adversaries of the Brotherhood of Assassins. Following the dissolution of the Order of the Ancients, the Knights Templar was clandestinely reconstituted in Wessex by Alfred the Great.</p>

            <p><strong>THE NEW WORLD</strong><br>
            Under the leadership of the zealous Grand Master Arkylos the Herald, the Templars initiated a strategic invasion through the ports of Alcaire. The siege endured for a relentless seven days and nights, catching the Brotherhood of Assassins off guard and resulting in their swift near-obliteration. The Assassins, refusing negotiations on equitable terms and believing in their advantage within their territory, prompted the Grand Templar Order led by Arkylos to adopt a particularly severe stance in its treatment of both civilian and assassin prisoners. Widespread torture became the norm, with little room for negotiation due to the uncooperative stance of the Assassin’s Council of Elders. The Mentor snatchup, seeking refuge behind fortified walls, inadvertently allowed the Templars to overpower the Assassins' vault in Alcaire and abscond with one of the two Apples of Eden in the New World.</p>

            <p>The Order found itself in the company of allied forces during its campaign against the heathen Fedayeen. Notably present were the German Bloodhounds, distinguished by their arquebuses, and the French Chasseurs, equipped with shackles—an organized ensemble of contingents. Alongside them, a third, more enigmatic legion, obscured in mystery, was known only by the cryptic appellation of the Black Cross.</p>

            <p>Arkylos spared no effort in eradicating the assassin's presence and reclaiming the land as his own. The determined Grand Master advanced from Alcaire to Eryas and ultimately to Roscrea. Erecting a formidable fort and a miniature citadel named Fort Engarde, the Templars maintained dominion over the region throughout Arkylos's reign. However, this era of Templar supremacy concluded abruptly when the Grand Master, driven to insanity by sleepless nights and the corrupting influence of the Apple of Eden, sustained severe injuries in battle. In a merciful turn of events, the Wrathful First Grand Master was laid to rest by his compatriot, Warmaster Jake of Tipples.</p>

            <p><strong>THE SECOND ERA</strong><br>
            Upon the untimely demise of Grand Master Arkylos, the mantle of leadership fell upon Regent Moro. Assuming the role of Grand Master, Moro adeptly steered the faction through a period of mourning and uncertainty. Recognizing his strengths, Moro gracefully handed over the reins to Warmaster Jake, ensuring a seamless transition of power. Wrestling with uncertainties about his ability to lead the faction with the same wisdom and grace as his predecessors due to his status as the ‘Warmaster’, Jake found himself at a crossroads. After careful consideration, he made the pivotal decision to pass on the title of Grand Master to a seasoned and respected figure within the Templar Order – the Seneschal, Skibbo the Impervious.</p>

            <p>The Warmaster, Jake, believed that Skibbo was the ideal candidate to guide the faction through the challenges ahead. With a selfless commitment to the greater good, Jake approached Skibbo and humbly offered him the mantle of Grand Master.</p>

            <p>Skibbo accepted the responsibility with a solemn nod and the transition was marked by a sense of unity, as Jake, despite his initial uncertainties, played a crucial role in ensuring a smooth transfer of leadership.</p>

            <p>Under Skibbo's guidance, the Templar Order continued to thrive, and Jake's self-awareness in recognizing his own limitations ultimately contributed to the faction's strength. The Templars forged ahead with a renewed sense of purpose, their unity standing as a testament to the wisdom in passing leadership to those best equipped to carry the mantle.</p>

            <p>Skibbo's right hand, Aezerix, oversaw the day-to-day operations of the Templar Order. His strategic acumen and organizational skills were crucial in maintaining the faction's stability. Skibbo was largely absent during Seneschal Aezerix’s term as Skibbo frequently returned to the Old World Nations to request reinforcements after his first Seneschal, Sleetsoul died peacefully of old age, which prompted Skibbo’s journey in the first place. During this period, the Templars were stagnant and faced external threats and internal strife, yet Aezerix's steady hand and unyielding determination became the glue that held the faction together.</p>

            <p>However, Skibbo fell victim to an ambush by two dozen assassins on his ship. In the aftermath of Skibbo's death, Aezerix, driven by grief and a sense of duty, assumed the mantle of Grand Master. He vowed to honor the old Grand Masters' memories by steering the Templars through the storm of chaos and rebuilding the faction stronger than ever before.</p>
