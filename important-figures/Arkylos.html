            <p><em>Arkylos:</em> Do note that the Arkylos and Eustathios, Euphiel are three different figures in lore of the same Dynasty. The user ‘Arkylos’ plays as all three characters in lore.</p>

            <h2>THE INQUISITOR</h2>
            <p>Prior to his elevation to the esteemed position of Grand Master, Arkylos served as a Black Cross Inquisitor dispatched by the Templar Sanctum of Electors. His mission was to infiltrate The Assassin Brotherhood, proving his worthiness for the New World Rite.</p>

            <p>Within the Brotherhood, Arkylos covertly implanted the seeds of Templar doctrine, collaborating with Moro of Karasu and Jake of Karasu, both esteemed Justiciars of the Order and eventual founders of the New World Rite. Assuming the role of a Sentinel guardsman and subsequently joining the Hunters division, Arkylos successfully gathered intelligence from unsuspecting assassins, gradually ascending to the esteemed rank of Chevalier within the Sentinels, a position of significance under Commodore Duckie.</p>

            <p>In his capacity as Chevalier, Arkylos continued to propagate the Templar ideology among the Sentinels. However, to avoid compromise and to broaden the candidate pool for potential Templar volunteers, he transitioned to the Hunters division. Unfortunately, this tenure was short-lived, as the Elders within the Brotherhood became privy to his machinations. The Assassins, isolated from the Old World for centuries, remained unaware of the Templar Order and its infiltrations, and merely suspected a simple turncoat within the Brotherhood, which wasn’t all that uncommon.</p>

            <p>Recognizing Arkylos's capabilities, the Sanctum of Electors appointed him to succeed them, bestowing upon him the title of the First Grand Master of the New World Rite. Accompanied by trusted allies Skibbo the Impervious, Moro the Regent, and Jake the Warmaster, Arkylos orchestrated a decisive restructuring within the Templar Order. Swiftly eliminating the previous Inner Sanctum, he consolidated the Templar Order under his and his Inner Sanctum's authority, transforming it into the Grand Templar Order. Establishing and taking over hospitals and forts throughout the Old World. In addition, Arkylos forged alliances with Christian nations of the Old World such as France, Prussia, and England, thus ushering in a new era of Templar dominance and influence.</p>

            <h2>THE HERALD, PREDECESSOR</h2>
            <p>Refusing negotiations, the Assassins believed in their advantage within their territory, unaware of the severe stance Arkylos and his Order would adopt. In response to the Assassin's uncooperative stance, widespread torture became the norm, with little room for negotiation. The Mentor Snatchup’s attempt to seek refuge behind fortified walls inadvertently played into the Templars' hands, allowing them to overpower the Assassins' vault in Alcaire and seize one of the two Apples of Eden in the New World.</p>

            <p>Exhibiting strategic prowess, Arkylos took command of the once French Royal Guards directly under the King of France. Under his adept leadership, he orchestrated a comprehensive reorganization, transforming them into the formidable Chasseur regiment within the Templar Order. Recognizing the need for diverse and specialized forces, Arkylos also sought the expertise of seasoned war veterans from the Old World Northern Crusade affiliated with the Teutonic Order. These esteemed veterans, possessing a wealth of experience, were entrusted by Arkylos to establish a regiment of battle-hardened fighters of Bloodhounds equipped with the latest advancements in warfare technology from the Old World – the Arquebus. The Bloodhounds were bloodthirsty crusaders turned mercenaries in the Old World. Even after the conclusion of the Northern Crusade, they continued to relentlessly eradicate pagans until Arkylos recruited them to fight against the assassins in the New World.</p>

            <p>The Templars briefly received an auxiliary force of Hospitallers to assist in establishing the Order within the New World. The auxiliaries undertook the construction and upkeep of Fort Engarde in Roscrea, serving as the initial strategic headquarters for the Templars in their conflict against the assassins of the New World. Unfortunately, the auxiliaries met a tragic fate when an explosion, triggered by the Apple of Eden, resulted in their demise. In the aftermath of this devastating event, their General Havoc died in the explosion whereas their leader, Maestra Defiant returned to the Old World, having sustained life-threatening injuries.</p>

            <h2>THE ERADICATOR</h2>
            <p>After finding out about the existence of Assassin Phantoms, the Black Cross strategically positioned their operatives within the Phantom contingent. Within a mere ten minutes of the Phantoms' comprehensive deployment, the Templar Order, along with the enigmatic Black Cross, orchestrated a revealing countermove. Notably, figures such as Justicar jikjiklolOfWyvern, Seneschal Skibbosoul, Inquisitor F_orged, Commander MrBalooni, Moro the Regent and other members of the Inner Sanctum played instrumental roles. Pope Celestine VI, also known as Jackophyte, delivered a compelling and destructive address during a diplomatic assembly between the Order and the Brotherhood. This oration effectively dismantled the elusive facade of the Phantoms, laying bare the intricacies of their contingent, including member identities, structural elements, hierarchy, and clandestine plans that ran afoul of earlier war crime conventions set by the Mentor and Grand Master.</p>

            <p>Arkylos spared no effort in eradicating the assassin's presence and reclaiming the land as his own. The determined Grand Master advanced from Alcaire to Eryas and ultimately to Roscrea. Erecting a formidable fort and a miniature citadel named Fort Engarde, the Templars maintained dominion over the region throughout Arkylos's reign. However, this era of Templar supremacy concluded abruptly when the Grand Master, driven to insanity by sleepless nights and the corrupting influence of the Apple of Eden, sustained severe injuries in battle. In a merciful turn of events, the Wrathful First Grand Master was laid to rest by his compatriot, Warmaster Jake of Tipples.</p>

            <h2>EUSTATHIOS ARKYLOS, THIRD POPE</h2>
            <p>Eustathios, a 'relative' of Arkylos, was approximately 20 years older than the Grand Master. He ascended to the Pontiff status following the demise of Pope Celestine VI due to old age. Despite his advanced age, Eustathios later became an Inner Sanctum councilman. His significant contribution lay in reviving the Pontificate through the establishment of a Monastery, resurrecting this revered institution. Driven by a profound love for knowledge, he diligently preserved the history of the Templars, ensuring the longevity of his institutions.</p>

            <p>Regrettably, Eustathios's reign proved to be short-lived, as he met an untimely demise through assassination by a fellow Templar. There is speculation that Euphiel, another relative of the Grand Master, was responsible for this murder. Nevertheless, widespread rumors of assassins being involved in the Pontiff's death fueled Euphiel's ascension to power as Euphiel is cleared of all charges.</p>

            <h2>EUPHIEL THE HONEST</h2>
            <p>Under the guidance of Eustathios, Euphiel ascended in status, achieving the remarkable position of Cardinal at an exceptionally young age, a distinction unprecedented in the history of the Templar Order. Euphiel seamlessly carried forward the initiatives set in motion by her predecessor, Eustathios, showcasing an unwavering dedication to the Templar cause. As Euphiel's influence continued to grow within the Templar ranks, so did the shadows of uncertainty surrounding her unconventional pursuits.</p>

            <p>The Templar Order found itself on a precarious precipice, torn between the fervent loyalty inspired by Euphiel's leadership and the looming suspicions that hinted at a divergence from the established path. Euphiel expressed a desire to wield both wisdom and might, stating, "In a realm where knowledge begets power and power manifests as strength, I yearn to command this dual dominion." This alludes to an old ideology, one that aligns with the belief that if knowledge is power, then the pursuit of power becomes insatiable.</p>
