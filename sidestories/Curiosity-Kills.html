            <p><strong>Curiosity Kills</strong></p>

            <p>Amir couldn’t take it anymore.</p>

            <p>As he climbed the ranks of the Assassin Brotherhood, learning more and more about what was below the surface, his curiosity grew stronger while his tolerance for authority and instruction waned. As an initiate he followed his orders without second thought, yet now that he had reached Veteran he could barely stand any form of instruction. But what truly infuriated him, what really itched him in a way that he couldn’t stomach anymore was the lack of information they were willing to indulge him in. Amir had heard the odd word about “artefacts” in the possession of the philosophers, something that no matter how much he inquired about he was met with nothing but fabricated ignorance. He knew he could be trusted with such information but as far as he could see his higher ups treated him with nothing but disrespect and insult to his intelligence. And he couldn’t take it anymore.</p>

            <p>Amir had ultimately decided that the warnings to not trespass on other divisional bases were little more than suggestions. Besides, his brothers and sisters in hunters would surely back him up, "see no evil," right? Either way, it didn’t matter to him. He was an Adept rank in Hunters and for Amir this was all he needed to do what he now deemed the only possible method to acquire the truth: infiltrate the philosophers base. Root through all of their precious books until they told him what the high ranks refused to tell him.</p>

            <p>In his mind the plan was foolproof. He had a goal, a method, and a backup in case something went wrong. Even still, he was convinced nothing could go wrong. To himself, Amir was untouchable.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Eryas’ roads were desolate. Amir was all that separated the Assassin’s stronghold from being completely asleep, the air thin with the cold breeze of the night and the gravity of the task Amir was about to undertake. He had waited for this window for what felt like aeons and he was more than prepared to seize the moment. He had studied the movements of the Philosophers whenever they made their seldom appearances, stalking them and eventually tracking them down to a cave behind the citadel. And now he had reached the point of no return, the door of the Philosopher’s Cave opening as he removed his lockpick from the door. The interior of the room he was met with only seemed to fuel his rage, the cosy atmosphere of that central room, the leisurely furniture, even the mere scent of the books filled his mind with images of pretension. Amir would never admit it, but he was blinded by his unruly rage. He wasted no time, moving swiftly to the bookshelves in the next room before beginning to almost frantically skim his eyes over the spines of all the books he could see. Anything related to an artefact. Anything that he could find that would make this all worth it. God, if he could just find ANYTHING that vaguely fit into the snippets he’d heard about this secret…</p>

            <p>There. Something on the shelf. All Amir needed to see was “Artefacts” before grabbing it from the shelf with enough haste to knock over two other books on either side, their covers clunking against the stone floor. He began to flip through. Hands moving on their own. Brain on autopilot while it looked for the slightest buzzword or-</p>

            <p>…</p>

            <p>Diagram. There it was. A refined sketch of a spherical object, ornate with carvings of a pattern he had never seen before. All complete with an underlined name with undeniable connotations. “Apple of Eden.” Finally, his scepticism had been rewarded, his undeniable truth finally validated. He really WAS being lied to all this-</p>

            <p>WHACK. His legs gave way, his shins burning as something struck them. Before Amir could respond he found himself floored, staring into the cold eyes of his attacker. A Phantom. Clutching Amir’s robes as if to hold him by his collar. His hand reached for the hilt of his blade.</p>

            <p>“Don’t.”</p>

            <p>The Phantom delivered his instruction bluntly, turning his left wrist to present his hidden blade to Amir. In less than a second Amir would be dead where he stood if he didn’t cooperate.</p>

            <p>“They LIED to us. They’ve been keeping this from EVERYONE like we’re some CHILDREN, don’t you SEE?!” He yelled with the intensity of a man in a situation five times worse. The cat was out of the bag by now, what was the use of discretion? Besides, his rage surpassed all in this moment.</p>

            <p>“All I see is a screaming fool. Be quiet.”</p>

            <p>Amir was shoved against the ground and cuffed before he could attempt to fight back, his emotions clouding any fighter's judgement he might have had anywhere else.</p>

            <p>As he was handed over to a group of sentinels just outside the cave, his anger couldn’t seem to manifest anymore. He’d tired himself out. Even still, it didn’t make the gruelling drag to his cell any less painful.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>As Amir stared up at the ceiling, he cursed himself. He’d traded his efficiency for haste. Costed himself what could have been a revolution that made him a legend. As his rage failed yet again to emerge he was forced instead to reflect. And he wondered. Just how much more would those books have taught him if he’d have just been more careful?</p>

            <p>Amir needed no judge to tell him he was never seeing the outside of that cell again. Regardless of how he viewed his attempt at uncovering the truth, glorious or tragic, the forbidden knowledge of the apple’s existence would die with him.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Unbeknownst to the people of Eryas, the cave previously occupied by the Philosophers had caved in. Nobody could have had any idea of if this was a natural event or provoked by someone, and even if they did few seemed to even notice that it had happened.</p>

            <p>What couldn’t go unnoticed was a chilling sight found outside the town. Some took it as a tragedy, some as a warning.</p>

            <p>The corpse of a hunter, the sword still lodged deep in his shoulder.</p>
