            <p><strong>The divide amongst Lynx</strong></p>
            <p>Anger. Resentment. But above all, confusion.</p>

            <p>The Purge of Alcaire took nearly everything out of the Lynx bloodline. They fought with all their souls, witnessing untold amounts of bloodshed and dragging themselves by their teeth all the way through hell and back. It would be a great falsehood to say that this wasn’t what they’d signed up for. They knew the risks, all the hardships and sacrifices they’d have to make for The Assassin Brotherhood. They stared the terms of their enlistment down and spat in the faces of their doubts. This was an idea worth fighting for, a creed worth dying for. And yet, all their persistence was thrown into question.</p>
            
            <p>Their faith was placed not into an organisation, but a brotherhood. Brothers. Sisters. That is all they ever expected of the creed. A name, a symbol and a maxim they could all fight under as equals. No more than people, but no less than brothers and sisters. Through all the harsh lessons and stoicism of the council, they expected the same respect they placed unwaveringly upon them. So where were they? Where had their family gone?</p>
        
            <p>Mentor Snatchup was nowhere to be seen at the purge. He had hidden himself away from all the carnage. Sent his peons to suffer and die for him. These actions, simple as they were, threw the Lynx bloodline off.  How many lies had they been told in their training? Could they have even been able to tell? How many times did they respond “Yes, Assassin” to a sentiment built on a foundation of sand? How much did these people, scholars and teachers they had grown to love, disrespect them so viciously?</p>
        
            <p>The betrayal of their superiors had changed the Lynx. Their world, believing in the strength of freedom and the acceptance of society’s fragility, had crumbled like gravel. And in the time they took to attempt to build up their world once more, some of them came to another truth. The truth that their mentor never told them and their brothers and sisters could never understand:</p>
        
            <p>That’s all it ever was. Unstable. Baseless. Dishonest.</p>
        
            <p>As they hid in the outskirts of Alcaire, the campfire dying as the Grand Templar Order slaughtered the stragglers of the battle, their philosophies underwent a change. They had been broken down, and they tried to repair themselves, even despite missing pieces. Some separated the creed from its false prophets, and returned to the brotherhood, condemning the mentor but their faith in the maxim unwavering. Some were directionless, left in the limbo of their own fractured minds. </p>

            <p>But for some, the gaps were filled with something else, and they were forged anew.</p>

            <p>The Assassin’s Brotherhood and it’s creed were flawed. At it’s core it may have meant well, but it was no way for the world to function. Not if it could allow this to happen. No, the world required structure. Order. Containment. </p>

            <p>If nothing was true, there was no room for integrity. If everything was permitted, there was plenty of room for injustice. The only real freedom the Assassins wanted was from their actions, and they required guidance.</p>

            <p>And from that day forward, while most of the Lynx had gone off the grid or returned to the brotherhood, the others made a vow.</p>

            <p>They vowed that the Father of Understanding would guide them all.</p>
